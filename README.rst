pyincept
========

A simple Python application designed to incept new Python project by creating
a standardized project structure complete with shell directories and stub
files, with package name, to start the project off.

This project was created to fill what looked like a lack of standardized
conventions practices for structuring Python projects, and out of the desire
to avoid the need to manually create the same directory and file structures
over and over again.

If you come across this project and know of other project which acomplish
similar goals, or of standards around Python project structure, would
welcome hearing about them.  Shoot me an email at avanherick@gmail.com.
